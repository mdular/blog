<h1>About</h1>

<p>My name is Markus. I'm currently living in Berlin, where i enjoy the parks in summer and compensate the lack of sun in winter. Feel free to <?php echo CHtml::link('drop me a line', $this->createUrl('site/contact')); ?>.</p>

<p>Apart from working in IT at Rocket Internet i like getting into little side projects, and this personal space is the latest one.</p>

<p>At the moment i'm rather focused on the technical side of mdular.com, and then some design work will have to be done - so please forgive the lack of polishing and sparse content ;)</p>
